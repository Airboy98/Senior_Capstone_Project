# Senior_Capstone_Project
Gro-Log is a system consisting of two components: software in the form of a program and a Raspberry Pi 3, the hardware to run it on. The program will be written in Python using the Kivy Python module for the GUI and stores item data in a local mySQL database transferred from an online database, hosted on the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi will be hooked up with 3 attachments: a USB Wi-Fi dongle to allow internet access, a wired USB barcode scanner to scan in items, and a touchscreen display to allow the user to interact with the device and manipulate item data. The system is designed to easily allow the user to scan in and/or input new items into the database and remove said items. Once items exist in the database, the user can then interact with these items, view nutritional information and opt to search Google for recipes containing those items.
